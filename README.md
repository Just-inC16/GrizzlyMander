# Brief Description of the Project

The project goal is to create a gerrymandering application that finds random congressional districtings for three US states such as Utah, Alabama, and Louisiana that achieve population equality. Gerrymandering is the drawing of district boundaries that favors one political party. A gerrymandered state would structure boundaries with the use of cracking(distribute the other party's votes to reduce the voting power) and packing(placing voters in the same area).
